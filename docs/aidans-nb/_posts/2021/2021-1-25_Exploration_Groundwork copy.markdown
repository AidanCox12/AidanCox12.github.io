## Data Exploration (1)

Today I accomplished the groundwork to start my data exploration. I re-evaluated my research question:

How does vertical habitat use differ in blue and mako sharks accross the Northwest Atlantic?

Next I read the Madigan et al. 2020 paper suggested by Camrin through slack

In their paper, Madigan and colleagues described the vertical habitat distributions of 12 pelagic marine predators in the Southern Atlantic ocean using PSAT tag data. They classified predators into four clades of habitat-use based on time-at-depth and time-at-termperatue data, where each clade was classified by different levels of themocline usage. They compared proportions of daily time at depth against dissolved oxygen (DO) ad lunar cycles to explore physiological and prey-mediated differences in vertical habitat. The authors discovered that several species had high tolerances for low dissovled oxygen and that, in several species (bigeye, yellowfin, and swordfish), response to light and lunar phase suggested strong deep scattering layer foraging. There were high inter and intra-specific differences between individuals, however temperature was a strong limitation for vertical habitat use in all species. Interestingly, regional endothermy adaptations was not sufficient to classify species into different clades.

Clade : Species : Description
Clade 1 : Dolphinfish, blue marlin, sailfish, silky shark : limited by top of thermocline
Clade 2 : Wahoo, oceanic whitetip, yellowfin tuna : limited by top of thermocline with brief dives into thermocline
Clade 3 : Tiger shark, Galapagos shark : Oscillatory dives, through termocline and limited by thermocline floor
Clade 4 : Blue shark, bigeye tuna, swordfish : igh sub-thermocline use

From this brief reading of the paper, I learned that my data analysis should follow this process:

Look for general differences in depth usage and v. habitat 
THEN
Hypothesise and try to explain what factors and env. variables may be driving these differences

Goals for Tomorrow:
1. MAKE SOME SUPER AWESOME FIGURES
  a. Heatmaps of depth use proportion by time of day 
  b. Time-at-depth histogram
  c. Time-at-temperature histogram
  d. Make map of diving patterns
  e. make animations of movement
